# DataProductsTest

This has been a test for a problem displaying an interactive map
created using plotly and published on RPubs.

I created a choropleth map using plot_ly and it displayed 
correctly (and is interactive) in RStudio.

However, when I put the code in an Rstudio presentation (.Rpres), the map appears in the slide, but it is not interactive, and is tiny - like a thumbnail of the map.

When I used an ioslides_presentation and published to gh-pages, 
it appears to work correctly.

Bottom line: this appears to be a part of, or related to the know problem 
with slidify to Rpubs publication.
